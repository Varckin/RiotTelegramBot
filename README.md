# RiotTelegramBot
This bot will help you obtain information about a player using their in-game nickname, and it will also send a photo of the champion's stats.
To get started, you need to create a file with your RIOT API key and your Telegram Bot token. You will also need to download champion data from the RIOT website for the champion ID to NAME converter to work correctly.
